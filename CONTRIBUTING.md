## Reporting a package bug

Please note: this issue tracker if for problems regarding the contents of the MiKTeX package repository. So it is okay to report issues like the following:

- `xyz` should be added to the repository
- `xyz` is incorrectly packaged

This issue tracker **is not** for software bugs (defects in MiKTeX programs).

Please do not report functional package problems (e.g., `! Undefined control sequence.`).

Thanks!
