## Reporting a package bug

Please note: this issue tracker if for problems regarding the contents
of the MiKTeX package repository. So it is okay to report issues like
the following:

- `xyz` should be added to the repository
- `xyz` is incorrectly packaged

__This issue tracker is not for software bugs (defects in MiKTeX programs).__

__Please do not request a packages update unless the MiKTeX version
lacks behind the CTAN more than a month.__

__Please do not report functional package problems (e.g., `! Undefined control sequence.`).__

Thanks!
